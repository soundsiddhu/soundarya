Data Analysis is Synthetic Sales Data Project
Project Overview

This project demonstrates basic data analysis using Python on a synthetic sales dataset.
The aim is to understand sales performance by analyzing revenue, units sold, regional contribution, and monthly trends.

Objectives

Generate a synthetic dataset using NumPy and Pandas

Perform descriptive statistical analysis

Calculate total revenue

Identify regional sales performance

Visualize trends using charts

Interpret insights from data

Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3

Pandas is data manipulation

NumPy is random data generation

Matplotlib import chart visualization

Dataset Description

The dataset is artificially generated and contains 24 rows (2 years of monthly data) with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Month	Month number (1–24)
Region	Sales region (North, South, East, West)
Units_Sold	Number of units sold
Price_per_Unit	Price of one unit
Total_Revenue	Units_Sold × Price_per_Unit
Steps Performed

Data Generation – Created synthetic sales data using random values.

Data Cleaning – Checked for missing or duplicate values.

Feature Engineering – Calculated Total_Revenue.

Descriptive Statistics – Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, and Range.

Aggregation – Revenue grouped by region.

Visualization

Bar Chart is Revenue by Region

Line Chart is Monthly Revenue Trend

Key Insights

Certain regions contribute more revenue than others.

Monthly revenue shows fluctuations indicating possible seasonal demand.

Revenue is influenced by both unit sales and price variation.

Conclusion

This beginner friendly project provides hands on experience with the complete data analysis workflow including data creation, statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation. It helps build foundational skills required for real world analytics projects is predict the data for future use
